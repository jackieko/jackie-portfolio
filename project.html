              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Jupiter is a cloud storage platform that takes sharing student documents and files in real-time collaboration to the next level. With added social networking functionalities and study resources to help in efficient and productive studying, Jupiter means less time formatting and more time studying the good stuff.</p>

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>In this project, I was tasked with creating a cloud storage and organization interface that had all the functionalities of sharing, collaborating, and uploading content such as documents, videos, and images. In conjunction to this, the client emphasized the importance of having collaborative features to all of these elements. However, the cloud storage platform is a well-established and highly saturated market that would be challenging to build out a unique experience for users.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project-content-card">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I created a simplified, intuitive digital platform where students have ‘Personal’ and ‘Shared’ drives to house all of their files and notes. With the drive functionality, I designed a social networking aspect to the platform called ‘Galaxy’ that allows students to easily gain insight as to what their classmates are studying and who they are studying with. In addition, I ideated an innovative, built-in technology that could analyze documents to auto-generate flashcards based off of key phrases so that students can study more efficiently.</p>

          <div class="project-content-card">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>When first presented with this project, I decided to go through the entire design process since the client had some brief outlines for what they wanted and I was trying to build a more robust case study for what to make of this cloud storage platform.</p>
            <!--Start of Step by Step Processes-->
            <div class="project-content-step">
              <h4>User Research & Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>Users also valued the collaborative aspects of these drives and having an up-to-date saved file of their documents/files over other features like creating documents and organizing.</p>
              <p>Granted, I only had a small sample size but I gained a better understanding of people’s intent when using these services. I also asked a pool of users that were both working professionals and students so this was first when I noticed the break up of the professional and student use cases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-step">
              <h4>User Persona</h4>
              <p>Understanding that many of the competitors split up their target market into the student and the business user, I began to realize that there could be very different intentions and behaviors that a student might have from a business user. I built out two different users to build out these potential users and which target group to cater towards.</p>

            <div class="project-content-step">
              <h4>User Flows</h4>
              <p><b>Sharing a File</b></p>
              <img src="images/jupiter/uf-sharing-file.png" class="small-img">
              <p><b>Creating a Flashcard</b></p>
              <img src="images/jupiter/uf-flashcard.png" class="small-img">
            </div>
            <div class="project-content-step">
              <h4>Wireframes & Mockups</h4>
              <p>Taking all the processes of the user flows and stories, I came to develop sketches that answered all the questions of sharing and creating files.</p>
              <img src="images/jupiter/wireframe-1.png" class="small-img">
              <img src="images/jupiter/wireframe-2.png" class="small-img">

              <p>I wanted to sketch out an interface that was intuitive for users to share and create files. Through this process, I wanted to streamline the process for the student user as I found more of a niche market there. I wanted to fully flesh out the flashcard and community features, and in doing so, I focused it on what students needed.</p>
              <h4>First Iteration Mockups</h4>
              <img src="images/jupiter/mockup-1.1.png" alt="" class="big-img">
              <img src="images/jupiter/mockup-1.2.png" alt="" class="small-img">
              <p>For my first iteration of mockups, I found that I could maximize the drive spaces by just inputting files, folders, and flashcards in the shared and personal pages. This was to further incorporate the community feed where users could discuss and see those “transactional” exchanges between people within the network.</p>
              <p>My continued conversations with students helped me reiterate this idea of having a community feed to help students gain a better understanding of what material they needed to study for future exams. They also really appreciated the idea of the auto-created flashcards that would generate a set list of flashcards based off the notes that were in the drive. I also made the landing home page experience be the “shared” dashboard view since the main point of this cloud platform was to have these shared features of collaborating with other students.</p>

            <img src="images/jupiter/brand-sketches.png" class="small-img" width=600>
            <p>I initially began my branding process with a simple mind map sketch to think of brand names for the app interface. After brainstorming with various names, I decided to go with Jupiter.</p>
            <div class="brand-mission" style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville'">
              <p>Brand Mission:</p>
              <p>To provide a minimalistic approach to organizing files and sharing with a larger network of colleagues and peers. Much like the vast network of a cloud service providing access to various personal drives, Jupiter is part of a larger galaxy and universe.</p>

            <ul class="feedback">
              <p>After my second iteration of usability testing, I learned a couple of points:</p>
              <li>All were able to understand the layout of the dashboard</li>
              <li>Users liked the separation of personal and shared files</li>
              <li>Galaxy was a success in knowing what everyone was studying as long as there was an option to make files private and public</li>
              <li>Marketing page can be flushed out more to include more of the highlighting features of Jupiter like Galaxy and flashcards</li>
              <li>Users liked that there was an added layer of a cloud storage app</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based off the user tests and feedback I had received, I was able to make the appropriate changes and present a final product that achieved the goals of the client: create a cloud storage platform that can share files and collaborate with others. I think the outcome of the project has successfully created a niche market for Jupiter with its added functionality of a community feed, and technology to auto-create flashcards.</p></br>
            <p>Initially going into the project, I found that it was difficult to create something that was different from pre-existing products. However with more user testing and feedback, there seemed to be a greater need for students so I was able to shift the focus more towards student goals. Going forward, I could potentially work this platform to be more inclusive of business users and building out those needs. Overall, Jupiter was a successful cloud storage platform that users understood and were able to use in an easy way.</p>
