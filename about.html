        <h2>Hey there! I’m Jackie, a Korean-American product designer currently located in Boston.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I grew up in Northern Virginia, just outside of Washington D.C. where I developed my true passion of product design. My dad, previously a civil engineer, is crazy about straight edges and fast math. At a young age he taught me how to 1) use a ruler and 2) use that ruler to make awesome, well-designed trifolds for school projects. My mom, previously a fashion designer, is scrappy and incredibly creative. She taught me how to think on a grand scale when it came to “thinking outside the box.” Meshing the two, I began to utilize my unique toolkit of a protractor and sewing needle— intertwining the technical with creative. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I currently work as a business associate at Wayfair where I work closely with my cross-functional teams to build out actionable business strategies to ultimately serve the customer. Throughout my role, I’ve analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to create stories that help us better understand the customer journey. Much like what product designers do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This customer oriented lens has served me greatly in building out user-centered products. I love that I am able to use both my technical skills to data collect and research while leveraging my creative abilities to make innovative solutions for the user. I believe that great user experience design is much like that of a well-seasoned cast iron: an iterative process that takes time and a number of user tests to develop and refine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wherever I may be, you can leave it to me to wield my protractor and sewing needle to solve the next user problem.</p>
